**Lesson 1: Installing and Using Python**\n\n* **Installing Python:** Download and install Python 3.9.1 from python.org.\n* **Opening the Python Shell:** Go to the Windows search bar, type "python", and select "Python Idle".\n* **Python Execution:** Python executes code one line at a time, making it easy to experiment.\n\n**Variable Types and Operators:**\n\n* **Variables:** Python variables do not need to be declared and can change types dynamically.\n* **Strings:** Enclosed in quotes (e.g., "hello world").\n* **Integers:** Whole numbers (e.g., 7).\n* **Floating-Point Numbers:** Numbers with decimal points (e.g., 7.0).\n* **Operators:**\n    * Addition (+): x + y\n    * Subtraction (-): x - y\n    * Multiplication (*): x * y\n    * Division (/): x / y\n    * Modulo (%): x % y (remainder after division)\n    * Exponentiation (**): x ** y (raise x to the power of y)\n\n**Formatting Prints:**\n\n* Separate items with commas to print multiple values at once.\n* Use quotes to print strings as strings (e.g., "x + y = z").\n\n**Homework Assignment:**\n\n* Calculate the circumference and area of a circle with a given radius.\n* Format the output to display the results in a readable way.\n\n**Next Lesson:**\n\n* Arrays (lists)
The most important lesson is to understand the fundamental concepts of Python, such as variables, data types, operators, and control flow. This will provide a solid foundation for learning more advanced concepts in the future.
